# Merge Two Sorted Arrays 

## Project Description

This Java project merges **two sorted arrays** into one sorted array.
The first array (`arr1`) has extra space at the end to accommodate all elements of the second array (`arr2`). The merged array is stored in `arr1`.


## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, and integers `m` and `n` representing the number of valid elements in each array:

* Merge `arr2` into `arr1` **in-place**.
* The final array in `arr1` should be **sorted**.

**Example Input:**

```java
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3
arr2 = [2, 5, 7], n = 3
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```
